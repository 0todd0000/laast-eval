LAASTv2 was download from https://www.niiler.com/biomech/LAASTv2.zip on 2021-08-30 and is redistributed under the terms of its GPL (GNU General Public License), according to the GPL license associated with this repository (laast-eval). See ./laast-eval/LICENSE for details.

NOTE!
While some of the individual R files in LAASTv2 contain GPL license details, it is not obvious whether the GPL license extends to all files contained in LAASTv2.zip; the PY files and the buildFiguresExtra.R file, for example, do not mention and license information. I am redistributing all files in LAASTv2 on the assumption that the GPL applies to all files. I am presuming that this is not a problem because the these contents are already distributed freely at the link above; this link was published in Niiler (2020).  If I have misunderstood the terms of the license I would be happy to remove all files that do not explicitly contain GPL licenses. If you are the copyright holder on these items and would like them removed from this repository (laast-eval) please contact Todd Pataky at pataky.todd.2m@kyoto-u.ac.jp.
